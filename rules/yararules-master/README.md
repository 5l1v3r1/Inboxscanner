# yararules
Rules for yara.  Mostly for use with VT.

WARNING:  Don't trust other people's yara rules to do what they are supposed to do.  Sometimes they're easy to validate.  Othertimes, such as when you don't have a test sample, they're not.  I've seen yara rules that are attributed to certain breaches that have no basis in reality.  If you can't trust the rule to do what you want, write your own.  It is easy.
